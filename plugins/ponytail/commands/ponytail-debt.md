# /ponytail-debt

Read and follow `skills/ponytail-debt/SKILL.md` in this plugin in full.

Harvest every `ponytail:` comment in this repository into a debt ledger so deferrals do not rot into "later means never". Grep the whole tree for comment markers (`grep -rnE '(#|//) ?ponytail:' .`, skipping `node_modules`, `.git`, and build output). One row per marker, grouped by file: `<file>:<line> — <what was simplified>. ceiling: <the limit named in the comment>. upgrade: <the trigger to revisit>.` Tag any marker that names no upgrade path or trigger as `no-trigger`. End with the count of markers and how many lack a trigger. If none: `No ponytail: debt. Clean ledger.` Report only, change nothing.
